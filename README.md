# chat-example

This is the [modified] source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Features include:
    usernames,
    userlist,
    private messaging,
    user is typing,
    user has joined or left the chat,
    chat time stamps.

Use 'node index' to run on localhost:3000

If you're hosting online,
be sure to look at /scripts/chat.js and point io.connect to your URL.

Thanks!
