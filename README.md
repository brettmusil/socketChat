# chat-example

This is the [modified] source code for a very simple chat example used for
the [Getting Started](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/) guide
of the Socket.IO website.

Use 'node index' to run on localhost:3000

Use 'node server' to run online.
Make sure to look at /scripts/chat.js and make sure io.connect is pointing to your URL.
